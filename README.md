# RIO-to-STEMMA-Dual-v2

This board allows for STEMMA QT / Qwiic sensors to be easily added to a
roboRIO. The PCB includes a screw mount for more secure connection. Two
STEMMA QT connectors are provided, one facing towards the roboRIO power
input and one opposite.

## Disclaimer

This board has NOT yet been fabricated and mechanically verified. I've
done my best to check this in CAD. However, there could be small issues
yet to be discovered. Use at own risk.

Why did I publish before fabricating you ask? FRC rules which would not
allow the prototype to be used on a competition robot if the board is
made prior to Kickoff. This makes for e-waste (IMO). This board will be
sent to fab after Kickoff and updates will be made if needed.
